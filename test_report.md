## Risk Assessment

### üü¢ Low Risk
- **Authentication Security**: All security controls tested and passing
- **Game Mechanics**: Core gameplay functionality validated
- **Token Economy**: Economic systems working correctly

### üü° Medium Risk  
- **Integration Testing**: Limited integration test coverage
- **Database Operations**: Some database operations only unit tested with mocks

### üî¥ Action Items
1. **Set up test database environment** for integration tests
2. **Add performance testing** for high-load scenarios
3. **Implement end-to-end testing** for complete user workflows
